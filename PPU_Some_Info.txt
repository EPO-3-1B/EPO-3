Every spire needs 4 bytes (1 byte = 8 bits) of information.
- Y position of the top left corner of the sprite (0-255)
- Tile number from the sprite pattern table (0-255)
- Special attribute flags (horizontal/vertical flipping, palette number, etc.)
- X position of the top left corner of the sprite (0-255)

The ppu of the nes has 256 bytes of momory to store sprite information
maximum of 64 sprites at the screen at the same time.

6	Flips sprite horizontally (if "1")
5	Sprite priority (behind background if "1")
